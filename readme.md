Slurp data from Untappd into your site!

## Description ##
This plugin will slurp in all of your old checkins from Untappd (in small batches to keep their API folks happy). It'll also check hourly for any new checkins. New checkins will either add a new "Beer" post or update an existing one, if you've already had that beer.

**Upcoming:** Breweries.  

This is in progress now and the next addition. Add unique breweries to each beer (and collaborating breweries!) all tied together using the relatively new Term Meta.

**Upcoming:** UI!  
Amazingly, I don't want to have to use the command line to install this. I need to add UI to indicate user name,
to start the import, to stop an existing import (less important, frankly).

**Upcoming:** New Beer Failsafe  
Right now, if you have more than 25 checkins within an hour, you'll lose checkins 26+. Not a big deal normally, but if you deactivate the plugin for any length of time...


## Installation ##
For now, to start the whole shebang, need to run bs_start_import( $user ) somehow. This sets up a cron job that will backfill all old checkins for that user and import all new ones.


### Manual Installation ###

1. Upload the entire `/beer-slurper` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate Beer Slurper through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##
Q. Can I set my Untappd credentials by code?
A. Yes!
define( 'UNTAPPD_KEY',    'XYZ' );
define( 'UNTAPPD_SECRET', 'XYZ' );

This will also hide those settings from the Setting screen for situations where you don't want to reveal the keys to other admins without filesystem access.
